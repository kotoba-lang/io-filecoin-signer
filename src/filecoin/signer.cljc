  "secp256k1 signing for Filecoin — the `f1` path, on both runtimes.

  `io-filecoin` deliberately pins no curve: signing is a seam
  (`filecoin.protocols/ISigner`) so the same message code runs on a JVM, in a
  Worker, or behind a WASM capability import, and a key can stay in a
  Keychain. This repo is the seam filled in for the one case that needs no
  new cryptography — secp256k1, which `eth-crypto` already implements
  deterministically on both platforms.

  ## What differs from Ethereum, and it is only the last step

  The curve is the same and the signature is the same 65 bytes (r‖s‖v). The
  chains part company at address derivation and at what gets hashed:

  |  | Ethereum | Filecoin `f1` |
  |---|---|---|
  | address | keccak-256(X‖Y)[12:] | BLAKE2b-160(`0x04`‖X‖Y) |
  | digest | keccak-256 of the payload | BLAKE2b-256 of the message CID |

  Note the `0x04`. Ethereum hashes the 64-byte key; Filecoin hashes the
  65-byte SEC1 uncompressed form, prefix included. Omitting it produces a
  perfectly well-formed `f1` address for an account nobody controls, and
  nothing complains until a transfer disappears into it.

  ## What this cannot sign

  - **`f3` (BLS12-381)** — no implementation of that curve exists anywhere in
    this workspace.
  - **Delegated (type 3)**, the FEVM path. A delegated signature covers the
    RLP-encoded unsigned Ethereum transaction, keccak-hashed, not the message
    CID — see `filecoin.signature`. It is not even the same *shape*, which is
    worth writing down because a length check is the first thing that catches
    a caller feeding one to `recover-public-key`:

        EIP-1559 (type 2)   r ‖ s ‖ v          65 bytes, v ∈ {0,1}
        legacy EIP-155      0x02 ‖ r ‖ s ‖ v   67 bytes on mainnet, since
                                               v = chainId·2 + 35 = 663 takes
                                               two, and the leading byte says
                                               which kind it is

    (`EthLegacy155TxSignaturePrefix`; lotus normalises both through
    `ToVerifiableSignature`. Both shapes are present in this repo's mainnet
    vectors.) `eth-crypto` now has RLP, keccak and EIP-1559 signing on both
    runtimes, so building this is possible; what is missing is the exact
    Filecoin↔EthTransaction round-trip lotus requires, and getting it wrong
    produces a signature the network rejects rather than an error here."
